# SYNOPSIS
A super minimal twitter client

# MOTIVATION
Most of my communication has moved to the new internet. But there are still lots
of people on the old internet. This twitter client is broadcast-only so that you
can connect but you dont have to see those spammy "social media" feeds.

# HOW TO
Just read the `package.json` and change the appropriate flags. This project is
just a fork of 
[this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/anatine/blob/master/package.json)
project. So if you need more info or want to make your own fork, now you
know... now we know... now we know.
